# Notebooks Directory

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis, experimentation, and prototyping for the Aviation Anomaly Detection project.

## Purpose

The notebooks in this directory serve as a platform for initial data exploration, algorithm testing, and visualization before implementing production code in the src directory.

## Contents

This folder should contain:

- Data exploration notebooks
- Feature engineering experiments
- Model prototyping and comparison
- Performance visualization
- Algorithm testing and validation

## Expected Notebooks

- `01_data_exploration.ipynb`: Initial exploration of aviation communication data
- `02_feature_engineering.ipynb`: Experiments with different feature extraction methods
- `03_model_comparison.ipynb`: Comparison of different anomaly detection algorithms
- `04_hyperparameter_tuning.ipynb`: Experiments with model hyperparameters
- `05_results_visualization.ipynb`: Visualization of model performance and anomaly detection

## Responsibility

All team members contribute to the notebooks directory based on their focus areas:
- **Yesinka**: Data exploration and feature engineering notebooks
- **Yosafat**: Model prototyping and hyperparameter tuning notebooks
- **Samuel**: Evaluation metrics and results visualization notebooks

## Guidelines

- Keep notebooks well-documented with markdown cells
- Include clear section headers and explanations
- Clean up notebooks before committing (clear outputs to reduce file size)
- Use relative paths for data access
- Move production-ready code to appropriate modules in the src directory
- Name notebooks with a numerical prefix to indicate sequence
