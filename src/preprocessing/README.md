# Preprocessing Directory

This directory contains all code related to data preprocessing and feature extraction for the Aviation Anomaly Detection project.

## Purpose

The preprocessing modules transform raw aviation communication data into features that can be used for anomaly detection model training and evaluation.

## Contents

This folder should contain:

- Data loading and parsing scripts
- Audio processing utilities
- Text normalization and feature extraction
- Data cleaning and filtering modules
- Feature engineering pipelines
- Data transformation and normalization utilities

## Expected Modules

- `data_loader.py`: Functions to load and parse raw data
- `audio_processor.py`: Audio feature extraction from communication recordings
- `text_processor.py`: Text feature extraction from transcripts
- `feature_extractor.py`: Combined feature extraction pipeline
- `normalizer.py`: Data normalization and scaling

## Responsibility

Yesinka is responsible for:
- Implementing all preprocessing modules
- Ensuring data quality through the preprocessing pipeline
- Creating efficient and reusable preprocessing components
- Documenting preprocessing steps and parameters
- Coordinating with the modeling team on feature requirements

## Guidelines

- Implement preprocessing as modular, reusable components
- Include proper error handling for data inconsistencies
- Document all preprocessing steps and parameters
- Create unit tests for preprocessing functions
- Optimize for both batch and streaming processing
