# Source Code Directory

This directory contains all the source code for the Aviation Anomaly Detection project.

## Structure

- `preprocessing/`: Modules for data preprocessing and feature extraction
- `models/`: Implementation of machine learning models for anomaly detection
- `evaluation/`: Code for model evaluation and performance metrics
- `utils/`: Utility functions used across different modules
- `main.py`: Main entry point for running the anomaly detection system

## Responsibilities

- **Preprocessing (Yesinka)**:
  - Data cleaning and normalization
  - Feature extraction
  - Data transformation pipelines
  
- **Models (Yosafat)**:
  - Model architecture design
  - Model training procedures
  - Model serialization and loading
  
- **Evaluation (Samuel)**:
  - Performance metrics implementation
  - Model validation procedures
  - Results visualization
  
- **Utils**:
  - Shared by all team members
  - Common functionality used across modules

## Development Guidelines

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Write docstrings for all functions and classes
- Include unit tests for new functionality
- Use consistent error handling
- Log important events and errors
