# Evaluation Directory

This directory contains all code related to model evaluation and performance assessment for the Aviation Anomaly Detection project.

## Purpose

The evaluation modules provide metrics, visualization tools, and validation procedures to assess the performance of anomaly detection models.

## Contents

This folder should contain:

- Performance metric implementations
- Visualization utilities for results
- Model validation procedures
- Benchmark testing scripts
- Reporting tools for model comparison
- Real-time evaluation components

## Expected Modules

- `metrics.py`: Implementation of performance metrics for anomaly detection
- `visualizer.py`: Tools for visualizing model results and performance
- `validator.py`: Cross-validation and model validation procedures
- `benchmark.py`: Benchmark tests for model comparison
- `report_generator.py`: Tools for generating performance reports

## Responsibility

Samuel is responsible for:
- Implementing evaluation metrics and procedures
- Creating visualization tools for model results
- Designing validation methodologies
- Generating performance reports
- Coordinating with modeling team on evaluation criteria

## Guidelines

- Implement evaluation metrics as modular components
- Create clear, informative visualizations
- Document evaluation procedures thoroughly
- Include both offline and real-time evaluation capabilities
- Ensure reproducibility of evaluation results
- Consider domain-specific evaluation criteria for aviation anomalies
