# Models Directory

This directory contains all machine learning models for the Aviation Anomaly Detection project.

## Purpose

The models in this directory are responsible for detecting anomalies in aviation communication data using various machine learning and deep learning approaches.

## Contents

This folder should contain:

- Model architecture definitions
- Training scripts
- Model serialization and loading utilities
- Inference code for anomaly detection
- Hyperparameter configuration files
- Model versioning management

## Expected Modules

- `anomaly_detector.py`: Main anomaly detection model implementation
- `model_trainer.py`: Training pipeline for models
- `model_loader.py`: Utilities for saving and loading trained models
- `feature_selector.py`: Feature selection for model input
- `hyperparameter_tuning.py`: Scripts for optimizing model parameters

## Responsibility

Yosafat is responsible for:
- Designing and implementing anomaly detection models
- Creating efficient training procedures
- Optimizing model performance
- Implementing model serialization and loading
- Coordinating with preprocessing and evaluation teams

## Guidelines

- Implement models as modular, reusable components
- Document model architecture and hyperparameters
- Include model versioning information
- Create reproducible training procedures
- Optimize for both accuracy and inference speed
- Consider both offline and real-time detection requirements
